# IDS 706 Mini-project 2
### By Daniel Medina
## Description
In this mini project I am running a pandas script that takes data from a FIFA CSV file and performs some descriptive statistics on it.
Descriptive statistics include:
* Mean Population Share
* Top 5 countries with the highest TV audience
* Country's GDP
* Number of countries in each confederation
